# batect-bash-completion

[![Pipeline](https://github.com/batect/batect-bash-completion/workflows/Pipeline/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/batect/batect-bash-completion/actions?query=workflow%3APipeline+branch%3Amain)

Shell tab completions for [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/).

## Requirements

* [Batect](https://batect.dev) v0.73 or later in your project
* [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) v3.2 or later

## Installing

### With [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

```shell
brew install batect/batect/batect-bash-completion
```

If you haven't already, you'll need to add the appropriate configuration for Homebrew's Bash tab completion support to your `~/.bash_profile`.
[The Homebrew documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/Shell-Completion#configuring-completions-in-bash) has details on what is required.

You'll need to restart Bash for the change to take effect.

### Manual install with `bash-completion`

If you are already using [`bash-completion`](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion), place a copy of [`batect.bash`](batect.bash) in your completions directory
(usually `~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions`).

You'll need to restart Bash for the change to take effect.

### Manual install without `bash-completion`

1. Download a copy of [`batect.bash`](batect.bash).
2. Add the following line to your `~/.bash_profile` (macOS) or `~/.bashrc` (other operating systems): `source <path to batect.bash>` (for example: `source /completions/batect.bash`)

You'll need to restart Bash for the change to take effect.

## How this works

In order to enable multiple projects to co-exist with different versions of Batect (and corresponding different available options), the completion script
in this repository acts as a proxy to the completion script generated by the appropriate version of Batect.

[The original RFC for shell tab completion](https://github.com/batect/batect/blob/master/rfcs/2020-03-shell-tab-completion/proposal.md) has further explanation.
